**Abstract**
 To address the growing interest in pets among the aging society, especially the retired baby  boomers during the pandemic, we conducted a study on the awareness of virtual pets. Due to the time and financial commitments associated with raising a pet, many people may feel
 hesitant to adopt one. As a result, there has been a rise in the popularity of virtual pets as an alternative. To explore this topic, we developed an Augmented Reality(AR) pet application called Lets Go Bailey. Through this application, we investigated whether a virtual pet could provide a similar experience to a real pet. We also explored whether a virtual pet could motivate its owner’s physical activity in the same way as a real pet. Furthermore, we examined the limitations of current AR technology and mobile devices for creating virtual pets. By doing so, we aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the feasibility of virtual pets as a substitute for real pets
